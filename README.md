Using the library
-----

You can install Treebeard with bower. In your project simply run 

```bower install treebeard --save```

Remember to reference the required files through bower_components. 


You can also just take the files in `/dist` folder. You need the css and js files, either minified or in full and add them to your project page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/treebeard.css" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/mithril.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/treebeard.js"></script>
```
